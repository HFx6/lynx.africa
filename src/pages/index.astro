	<!-- <h1>Lynx</h1>

	<p>
		The Lynx is a small cat. It is a genus with four species.[1] The four
		species are in Eurasia, Spain, Canada and America, and do not overlap
		much.
	</p>
	<h2>Appearance</h2>
	<p>
		Lynx have short tails, and usually some hair on the ears. They have
		large paws (feet) padded for walking on snow, and long whiskers on the
		face. The color of the body is from light brown to grey and is sometimes
		marked with dark brown spots, especially on the legs. They weigh about 5
		kg or about 11 pounds (approximately the size of a large domestic cat)
		and can weigh up to about 30 kg (66 pounds). They are between 70 and 150
		cm long, with a relative short tail - 5-25 cm. They live for about 20
		years. Lynx are similar to a regular house cat, but larger. They have a
		powerful body on short, furry legs attached to hefty feet, and a bobbed,
		black-tipped tail. The fur is spotted and yellowish-brown to grey. It
		has a collar of fur around the face, giving a triangular shape. They
		also have long black ear tufts.
	</p>
	<h2>Habitat</h2>
	<p>
		Lynx live in the high altitude forests with many shrubs, reeds and
		grass. They hunt only on the ground, but can climb trees and swim. They
		can be found in the some places in northern Scandinavia, in North
		America and also in the Himalayas. Since the 1990s people try to move
		part of the population of the Eurasian lynx to Germany. They can also be
		found in Białowieża Forest (northeastern Poland), and southern Spain.
		The Colorado Division of Wildlife tried to move other wild Lynx
		populations from Canada back to the United States.
	</p>
	<h2>Behaviour</h2>
	<p>
		Lynx are usually solitary, although a small group may travel and hunt
		together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a
		year the female gives birth to between two and four kittens. The young
		stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months,
		before moving out to live on their own as young adults. Lynx make their
		dens in crevices or under ledges. They feed on a wide range of animals
		from white-tailed deer, reindeer, roe deer, small red deer, and chamois,
		to smaller, more usual prey: snowshoe hares, fish, foxes, sheep,
		squirrels, mice, turkeys and other birds, and goats. They also eat
		ptarmigans, voles, and grouse.
